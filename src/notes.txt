Register allocation
Should some registers not be allocated because of function calls or instructions like mul https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mul
Which registers should be allocated first
System V ABI uses [rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9] for parameters
[rax, rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9, r10, r11] are scratch registers (caller saved)
[rbx, rsp, rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15] are preserved (calle saved)
[rax, rdx] store the return value
xmm0 - xmm7 are used for floating point

Ast function can have isLeaf that will be set during semnatic analysis
Leaf function don't need to allocate on the stack the top of the stack for themselves

Stack has to be aligned to 128 bits on function call for simd instructions
